+ The **Internet** is very different from a small computer network
+ Security becomes much more complex to discuss
+ An important quirk of the internet is its **layered structure**: each communication is in reality composed of smaller messages
+ How can we **ensure security** in such an eco-system?
+ The simplest and most effective idea comes in securing the **applications** themselves, like in some past protocols, but there are alternatives
+ We could also secure the communication between the Application and Transport layer (with **SSL**, ensuring end-to-end encryption)
+ But we'll instead see **IPSec**, which is capable of ensuring security on the transport layer itself
---
+ IPSec makes it possible to create a secure channel for all applications, using IP addresses for authentication
+ It is a **IETF Standard**
